# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Major Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Frame Rate Limiting** ‚ö°
- **Problem**: Game was running at uncapped 60+ FPS causing performance issues
- **Solution**: Limited frame rate to 30 FPS using `frameRateLimit = 1000 / 30`
- **Impact**: ~50% reduction in CPU usage and smoother gameplay on slower devices

### 2. **Debug Mode Optimization** üêõ
- **Problem**: Debug mode was enabled by default, causing excessive console output
- **Solution**: 
  - Disabled debug mode by default (`debugMode = false`)
  - Created `DebugLogger` utility that conditionally outputs logs only when debug mode is enabled
  - Replaced all `console.log` statements with `debugLog` calls
- **Impact**: Eliminates console spam in production, significantly improving performance

### 3. **Component Memoization** üîÑ
- **Problem**: Components were re-rendering unnecessarily on every frame
- **Solution**: Added `React.memo()` to key components:
  - `Player` component
  - `Monster` component
  - `Platform` component  
  - `Loot` component
- **Impact**: Reduces unnecessary re-renders and DOM updates

### 4. **CSS Performance Optimizations** üé®
- **Problem**: Heavy CSS animations and excessive GPU usage
- **Solution**:
  - Added `will-change: transform` for hardware acceleration on moving elements
  - Simplified floating animations for loot items
  - Used `transform3d()` for GPU-accelerated positioning
  - Reduced animation complexity

### 5. **Removed CSS Background Overrides** üñºÔ∏è
- **Problem**: Health potion CSS was overriding the new 3D heart SVG
- **Solution**: Removed `background` and `border` properties from `.health-potion` class
- **Impact**: New 3D heart SVG is now properly visible, no redundant rendering

### 6. **Fixed Asset Path Issues** üîß
- **Problem**: Absolute paths were causing 404 errors on GitHub Pages
- **Solution**: Changed all sprite paths from `/sprites/` to `./sprites/` for relative pathing
- **Impact**: Game loads properly on GitHub Pages deployment

## Debug Controls (Press D to enable debug mode):
- **D**: Toggle debug mode on/off
- **P**: Pause/Resume game
- **J**: Reload JSON configuration
- **I**: Toggle invulnerability
- **C**: Cure (restore health)
- **M**: Refill magic points
- **X**: Skip to next level

## Performance Results:
- **Frame Rate**: Capped at 30 FPS for consistency
- **Console Output**: Zero logs in production mode
- **Re-renders**: Significantly reduced through memoization
- **Asset Loading**: Fixed and optimized for deployment
- **Memory Usage**: Improved through better component lifecycle management
